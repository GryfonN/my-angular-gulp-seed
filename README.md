* **less** preprocessor task with + WATCH task

* **build** task contains less task as dependency

* **inject** task contains also less as dependency
 
* **clean** task delete also Css files in app, because they are generated

* **scripts** task run jshint only on changed files, no more browserSync reload

* **watch** task run browserSync.reload() on change event, but when index.html file is changed (C,D operations of *.js 
*.css files) **inject** task is started in sequence with new created task **reload-browser**. Sequence is granted by 
 **gulp-seq** plugin as new gulp task **injectAndReload**. Less changes start only less preprocessor, that wakes up css 
 watcher
